To inform the expiration event of automated usage to active clients. 
The first Tuint8 is the times the content has been informed, the second
 Tuint8 could either be 'E' or 'V', 'E' means expired and 'V' means 
 valid but about to expire. The third is permission type (which is 
 defined in caf.h, including EPlay, EExcute, EView, EPrint, EPeek). 
 The rest of data is the content ID. So, the whole format of the 
 values would be "<TUint8 aTimes><TUint8 aExpirationMark><TUint8
  aPermissionType><TDesC8 aContentID>".
